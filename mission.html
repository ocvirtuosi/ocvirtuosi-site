                        Virtuosi Chamber Music orchestra is a youth music
                        ensemble based in Orange County, California whose
                        mission is to serve communities through the joy of
                        music. We believe that music has the power to heal and
                        enrich lives. Music is a shared experience that connects
                        us all, across every border and background, across every
                        age and season of our lives.

                        Virtuosi’s mission is to enrich both the lives of its
                        students and the communities they serve. Through the
                        study and performance of classical and popular music,
                        with solo and leadership opportunities for its students,
                        Virtuosi is focused on fostering creativity and
                        connection among its members. Each season culminates in
                        a benefit concert to raise awareness and funds for a
                        partner charitable organization. Virtuosi members also
                        earn volunteer hours towards The President’s Volunteer
                        Service Awards.
