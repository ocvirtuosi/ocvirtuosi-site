                        VirtuoSi Chamber Music orchestra is a youth music
                        ensemble based in Orange County, California whose
                        mission is to serve communities through the joy of
                        music. We believe that music has the power to heal and
                        enrich lives. Music is a shared experience that connects
                        us all, across every border and background, across every
                        age and season of our lives.

                                VirtuoSi’s mission is to enrich both the lives
                                of its students and the communities they serve.
                                Through the study and performance of classical
                                and popular music, with solo and leadership
                                opportunities for its students, VirtuoSi is
                                focused on fostering creativity and connection
                                among its members. Each season culminates in a
                                benefit concert to raise awareness and funds for
                                a partner charitable organization. VirtuoSi

                                President’s Volunteer Service Awards.
